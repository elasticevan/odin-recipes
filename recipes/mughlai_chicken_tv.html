  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve always cooked a lot, but I found three recipes I know I&rsquo;ll be 
  making at dinner parties for life.&rdquo; 
  writes Dr. Taylor Alison Swift in her interview with Elle Magazine.
  One of those recipes is Nigella Lawson&rsquo;s Mughlai Chicken.  Bringing together a troop
  of well-balanced spices such as cumin, ginger, coriander, and chili -- we&rsquo;re guessing 
  this is Dr. Swift&rsquo;s go-to dish during the first fall of snow on a glistening December night.</p>	
  <p>Nigella Lawson strongly recommends using the moister brown meat, from the thigh, for
  this dish.  For full depth and resonance of flavour, she states to make it a<strong> day or two</strong> in
  advance and stored in the fridge.  The payoff is totally worth it.</p>
