  <h2 class="header">Description</h2>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve always cooked a lot, but I found three recipes I know I&rsquo;ll be
  making at dinner parties for life.&rdquo;
  writes Dr. Taylor Alison Swift in her interview with Elle Magazine.
  Jamie Oliver's Chicken Fajitas with Mole Sauce is a fitting choice when you only have
  22-25 minutes to spare. The doctor-approved recipe calls for clsasic fixings like onion,
  peppers, and mild chili powder along with dark chocolate for the mole sauce.</p>
  <p>Spicy, smoky, (like Dr. Swift&rsquo;s Reputation album) and deemed &ldquo;not too tricky&rdquo; to make, this crowd-pleasing
  dinner party dish isn&rsquo;t the only thing the mirrorball genius has learned over the
  years. &ldquo;I also learned how to immediately calculate Celsius to Fahrenheit in my head.
  (Which is what I&rsquo;m pretty sure the internet would call a &lsquo;weird flex.&rsquo;)&rdquo;
  It is a weird flex doc, but get it queen.</p>
  <h2 class="header">Ingredients</h2>
  <dl>
  <dt><h3><em class="subheader">Serves 3-4 (or one William Bowery)</em></h3></dt>
	<li>olive oil
	<li>1/2 tsp sweet smoked paprika
	<li>1/2 tsp mild chilli powder
	<li>1/2 tsp ground cumin
	<li>1x lime
	<li>1x large red onion
	<li>1x yellow pepper
	<li>1x red pepper
	<li>4x 120g skinless free-range chicken breasts (<em>aka &ldquo;The Scooter Braun&rdquo;</em>)
	<li>4x wholemeal flour tortillas (<em>use corn tortiallas if possible</em>)
	<li>4x sprigs of fresh coriander
	<li>4 tbsp natural yoghurt</li>
    <dt><h3 class="subheader">Mole Sauce</h3></dt>
	<li>2x medium ripe tomatoes
	<li>2 tbsp chipotle paste
	<li>1/2 tsp ground cinnamon
	<li>pinch of mild chilli powder
	<li>15g good quality dark chocolate (<em>70%</em>)
  </dl>
  <h2 class="header">Method</h2>
  <ol>
	<li>Place 1 tablespoon of oil into a bowl with the spices and half the lime juice.
	<li>Peel and finely slice the onion, then trim and deseed the peppers. Slice the peppers and the chicken breasts into 1cm strips.
	<li>Add the onion, pepper and chicken to the bowl of spices with a pinch of sea salt and black pepper and toss to coat. Leave to marinate while you make the mole sauce.
	<li>Drizzle 1 tablespoon of oil into a pan over a medium heat. Finely chop the tomatoes and add to the pan, followed by the chipotle paste and spices. Cook for 2 to 3 minutes, then pour in 200ml of hot water. Cook for a further 10 minutes, or until thickened, mashing the tomatoes to make a smoother sauce.
	<li>Remove from the heat and finely grate in the chocolate, stir until melted, then set aside for later. Wrap the tortillas in tin foil and put to one side.
	<li>Pour 1 tablespoon of oil into a large frying pan over a medium-high heat. Add the chicken and veg and fry for 6 minutes, or until cooked through, turning halfway. You may need to do this in batches.
	<li>Meanwhile, pop the parcel of tortillas into a low oven for 5 minutes to warm through. Cut the remaining lime half into wedges, pick and finely chop the coriander leaves, and put the yoghurt into a little bowl.
	<li>Remove the tortillas from the oven, and build the fajitas: take a wrap, spoon over some mole sauce and top with chicken and veg. Spoon over some yoghurt, scatter over a few coriander leaves and squeeze over a little lime juice. Nice served with a dollop of fresh guacamole.
